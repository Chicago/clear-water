							<p>All 26 miles of Chicago's shoreline along Lake Michigan belong to the public. Over twenty public beaches are open to 60 million annual visitors and residents. During the summer months, the cool waters of Lake Michigan provide a respite from the heat.</p>
         					<p>Most of the time, beach water quality is acceptable. But sometimes, rates of bacteria elevate to a level where swimmers are at risk of contracting an infection and developing flu-like symptoms.</p>
        					<p>Traditional testing methods do not return results quickly enough to provide realtime water quality notifications, or "beach advisories." Rapid DNA testing methods are available, but are costly when used daily at all beaches. Predictive modeling techniques have been developed, but do not yet provide accurate results reliably.</p>

								<h2>Innovative Science</h2>
								<p>Prior efforts to forecast beach water quality have adopted a similar approach. They collected meteorological data near a swimming site, and then predicted contamination levels in the water. The team's exhaustive efforts resulted in a conclusion that there are limits to this approach.</p>
								<p>The team developed a new approach that takes advantage of rapid DNA testing and the lessons learned from data exploration. First, just five beaches contribute to about 56% of poor water quality beach days. These beaches, which are some of the hardest to predict, should be routinely rapid tested due to their volatility. Second, water quality patterns at the remaining beaches are correlated into clusters. In the new approach, one beach from each of these clusters would be rapid tested to get an immediate result. The remaining beaches would be predicted by the model.</p>
								<p>A key feature of the new approach is its cost effectivness. The increased cost of rapid testing would be offset because only half the beaches would be tested. Yet it performs better and provides more accurate notifications to the public.</p>

								<h2>Collaboration &amp; Open Science</h2>
								<p>Clear Water is a collaborative work, and began as a <a href="https://chihacknight.org/projects/2016/05/01/e-coli-predictions.html">breakout group</a> at Chi Hack Night, a weekly meetup of people interested in civic tech. Data scientists volunteered over 1000 hours, and the City also partnered with students at DePaul University to develop data visualizations.</p>
								<p>Clear Water is also made available as an open source project. An <a href="https://github.com/chicago/clear-water/">open source approach</a> helps build a foundation for other models attempting to forecast violations at food establishments. The analytic code is written in <a href="http://r-project.org/">R</a>, an open source, widely-known programming language for statisticians. There is no need for expensive software licenses to view and run this code.</p>
								<p>Open sourcing the code also allows for collective advancement. The open source code contains the necessary data to let others test and try to improve upon the current analytic method. The project is also documented in a reproducible format, allowing researchers to read a description of the research and view its underlying calculations. The repository contains everything that is needed to let a community of researchers refine and derive better models.</p>

								<h2>Evaluating the Effectiveness of the Model</h2>
								<p>Data from 2006 through 2016 were used to conduct simulations. The 2017 Pilot was evaluated with actual results, collected after the model was developed.</p>
								<p>By mid-summer 2017, poor water quality conditions were detected 121 times at different beaches. The piloted model, paired with selective rapid testing, would have issued advisories for 69 of those occurances.</p>
								<p>Typically, the prior model would have issued advisories for only 9 out of 112 occurances by mid-summer. The new approach so far has detected 60 more occurances than the prior model. Further, as more data on rapid testing is accumulated, the new model's performance should perform even better.</p>
								<p>The new model also has better overall accuracy of predicting poor water quality. In 2017, the piloted model so far has an accuracy rate of 12%, which is 200% higher than the prior model's accuracy rate of %4 under similar conditions. By performing clustering algorithms to optimize the selection of predictor beaches, simulations consistently show accuracy rates of over 20 percent.</p>
								<p>This new approach to beach water quality forecasting requires a choice to be made: which beaches are tested and which are predicted. You can try making your own model to see if it can outperform ours.</p>

								<h2>Better Forecasts of Water Quality</h2>
								<p>Despite much effort by scientists and water quality experts, forecasting beach water quality remains a difficult and complex endeavor. There are dozens of suspected contributors to contamination. Our team of data scientists developed machine learning models to explore environmental patterns that lead to elevated bacterial contamination. Through this research, the team better understood the limits of forecasting water quality this way.</p>
								<p>During the 2015 and 2016 swim seasons, the Park District used a model developed by the USGS for beach advisories. Our team's analysis of that model showed that when water quality was poor, the model only issued an advisory between 6% and 11% of the time.</p>
								<p>The team initially developed a similar model, with more data and the latest data science techniques. After exploring relationships among variables, the team piloted the model in 2016. Simulations showed this model would have issued advisories about 10% of the time.</p>
								<p>Lessons learned while exploring environmental variables led the team to experiment with its new approach to forecasting water quality. The new modeling approach, coupled with a data-driven strategy for selecting beaches for rapid testing, has resulted in a cost-sensitive hybrid method for better forecasts of beach water quality.</p>
